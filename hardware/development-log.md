Ran initial tests on the slider portion of the robot.  Platform was not fastened to the bracket and wheel assembly yet.  Used a stack of books instead of camera because I do not trust the platform yet.  Motors seemed a bit strained, especially during longer periods of continuous rotation, which may be a necessary evil given my gearing options and fact that I am working with only one motor.

I then attached the brackets to the wood with screws.  The platform was not perfectly aligned with the direction of the wheels, but I do not think that this will significantly effect the direction of movement.  When the side alignment wheels are added, I will need to remember to take this into account.

First test of this configuration with books ran successfully.  Second test included camera with lens cap on facing forward, taking 10 pictures.  Also appeared successful.  For the third test, the lens cap was removed.  Evaluation of resulting video is pending.

Built the first part of the camera rotation assembly.  The direction of the motor's rotation is redirected 90 degrees by use of a screw gear.  The idea at this point is to have a circular turret mounted on top of a lazy susan bearing.  The motor will rotate it via a rubber wheel.

Initial tests with the current assembly show that the the screw gear assembly significantly slows the rotation of the wheel.  Pressure on the wheel could reduce contact between the gears, which is an issue I will need to watch out for.
